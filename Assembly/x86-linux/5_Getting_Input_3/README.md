### What i've learned

- Getting a good grip on assembly
    - This day i didn't nececarilly learn anything new, but this program is the perfection of what i wanted to make from `3_Getting_Input`. Also i'm now quite confident on looping and detecting segfault.

- Caller saved registers
    - Also i've gotten a good grip on caller saved registers. We are not obligated to save it, hence on some subroutines those registers are not save, and i ended up need to save the register first to sp before calling a function.
