### What i've learned

- Il2CppProtection
    - Some games have really good il2cpp protection, making dumping the binaries impossible. This is probably a dead end by now for il2cpp reversing. The protection can range from code Obfuscation and binary protection. There is another method though, where you dump the binary in runtime using game guardian, but most popular games already has protection for it. I guess games that are released before 2022 have an eazy vurnebility, but after that it becomes harder.
